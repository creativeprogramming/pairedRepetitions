Computes paired and unpaired exact repetitions within a genome quite
efficiently. Inspired by Nava Whiteford work for exact unpaired repetitions.
details of the algorithm are in Rayan Chikhi's PhD thesis (2012).

It might be a bit tough to compile, so here is a python version (with more readable algorithm), 
thats has hardcoded parameters:
- python pairs-v7.py 

Compiling the much faster C version:
- download Judy (http://sourceforge.net/projects/judy/files/latest/download)
  and put it in ./judy-1.0.5/
- type "make judy" to compile judy
- download argtable (http://argtable.sourceforge.net/) and put it in ./argtable2/ (remove the trailing version, e.g. "-14")
- type "make argtable" to compile argtable
- type "make -C ./my_sarray/" to compile suffix array extension
- type "make" to compile pairs-v7.c
- run ./pairs-v7

./pairs-v7 --help
Usage: pairs-v7 [-v] [-s <int>] [-d <int>] [-f <filename>] [--hd] [--mkesa]
[-l <int>] [--nopairs]
  -s, --sigma=<int>         define sigma value (default is 300)
  -d, --delta=<int>         define delta value (default is 0)
  -f <filename>             sequence to analyze
  --hd                      stores v[] on disk (in ./vfiles/)
  --mkesa                   use mkesa to build the suffix array and lcp (in ./mkesafiles/)
  -l, --length=<int>        set maximum read length (default is 16)
  --nopairs                 do not compute paired uniqueness, only single uniqueness
  -v, --verbose             verbose


To compute paired repetitions for very large (human-sized) genomes:
use a suffix array constructed by mkesa, requires ~60gb ram. feel free to send me a mail 
if you wish to perform this kind of experiment.

Why all the optimizations in this code? (e.g. 33-bits integers, multiple 1-byte judy arrays, 
several auxiliary data structures in pairs-v7) Back in 2008 I only had access to a computer
with 64 GB memory, and the structures supporting paired repetitions computations were too large.
Nowadays, i'd use compressed suffix arrays like the FM-index to replace the suffix array.
But I did not know about them back then.
